Android Build
=============


Quick info

	First compile DirectFB and ilixi for the host (to be sure that all
	headers and flux generated files are created)

	In DirectFB/build-android:

	Run
		./prepare.sh

	to fetch and unpack the required freetype2 sources

	Now in this directory:
		./prepare.sh

	Now make sure that your ilixi folder is in the same
	folder then your DirectFB tree:

       ~|-- whatever
	      |-- DirectFB
	      |-- ilixi


	Then go to the ilixi_widgets or ilixi_calc subfolders located in build-android and type
		./prepare.sh
		ndk-build
		ant debug

	to get an .apk in bin/.

	You can install it on the device by doing

		ant debug install


	The examples will need their files in /mnt/sdcard/directfb on your device. Do this:

		adb shell
		mkdir /mnt/sdcard/ilixi
		^D

	go to the ilixi folder and edit data/ilixi_config.xml
		Change
		<Background>@THEMEDIR:dark/bg.dfiff</Background>
		to
		<Background>@THEMEDIR:dark/bg.png</Background>

		Change
		<PixelFormat>DEFAULT</PixelFormat>
		to
		<PixelFormat>ARGB</PixelFormat>

		Edit data/themes/dark/palette.xml and change every 
		<color> 
		to
		<color alpha="255>
		
		Now copy the data folder to your sdcard:

		adb push data /mnt/sdcard/ilixi/



Now you should be ready to run ilixi_widgets and/or ilixi_calc on your android device!
